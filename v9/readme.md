<h1> Concert Network </h1>
<p> Social Networking site concept for people who want to share their experience at concerts around the world.
  The application uses the NPM package Passport for authentication and Express as the back end framework.
  The site is only meant to demonstrate my back end capabilities so it does not have the full UI/UX
  I would add if it were a commercial production. The main point is to illustrate the back end functionality using the database. Using mongoose I created various Schemas for concerts, users and comments. The authorization protocols are such
  that concert posts can only be edited by the user that created them. This is also true for comments and I encourage anyone
  looking at the site to make multiple accounts to see how buttons appear and disappear based on user permissions. The application also alerts users about what went wrong when their permissions are not accepted. </p>
